## Dataset

- Contains labeled high-resolution images of various skin diseases.
- Split into training, validation, and test sets.
- Images are preprocessed (resized, normalized, augmented) for robust model training.

## Model Architecture

- Utilizes a deep convolutional neural network with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dropout layers.
- Employs ReLU activation and softmax for output classification.
- Designed for multiclass image recognition tasks.

## Training

- The model is trained for multiple epochs with data augmentation to increase robustness and generalizability.
- Achieved a validation accuracy of 92% on unseen test data.
- Loss and accuracy trends are tracked using training logs and visualizations.

## Results

- **Accuracy:** 92% on test set.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Provides insight into model performance per class.
- **Application:** Enables early recognition of various skin conditions directly from images.
